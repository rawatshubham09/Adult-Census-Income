# Adult Census Income Prediction
- Adult Census Income Is a classification Problem in which we need to identify wether a person is earning more than Fifty Thousand Doller or not.
- Adult Census Income prediction is based on data collected by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics).
- This data has extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database.
- It is a Classification Problem so best model such as Random Forest Classifier , Logistic Regression used as a final Model for Prediction. 
- Parameter update feature given with model and validation data downloading is possible.
- In this Project we Perform CI/CD pipeline to automated the Process of Deployment on Heroku Cloud Platform.
